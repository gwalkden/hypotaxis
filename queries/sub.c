ignore_nodes: \**|CODE|ID|*RMV*node: CP*begin_remark: coding for clause type.This file codes cp's with embedded ip-sub(con)'s. Note that we can simply search on CP-type exists, since other CPs have been removed and we're ignoring removed nodes. Don't ignore CPX's, because we will ignore IPX's later.Col 1: clause typeqdir: direct questionrel: relativefrl: free relativetht: that-clause complementadv: adverbial clauseadvthat: adverbial that clausescmp: comparativedeg: degree clauseclf: cleftexl: exclamationqind: indirect q1x: unknownend_remarkcoding_query:1:  {	qind: (CP*-QUE* iDoms C)	qdir: (CP*-QUE* exists)	rel: (CP*-REL*|CP*-CAR* exists)	frl: (CP*-FRL* exists)	tht: (CP*-THT* exists)        adv: (CP*-ADV* exists)        cmp: (CP*-CMP* exists)        deg: (CP*-DEG* exists)        clf: (CP*-CLF* exists)        exl: (CP*-EXL* exists)        1x: ELSE       }
